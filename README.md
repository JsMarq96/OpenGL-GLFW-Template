# OpenGL GLFW Template
An empty project template for an OpengGL-GLFW project, with a basic Shader struct, and mouse & keyboard interaction.<br/>
I will keep updating this repo in order to keep adding all the boilerplate code and/or functionalities.<br/>
## To do
- Add text rendering. (Just bitmap fonts, for debugging purposes).
- Draw simple primitives.
- (Maybe) some basic performance monitoring tools.
